# EnvisionCodeInterview



So, here's the challenge:
Your challenge is to build a simple react app that uses an API to access data from a collection in a database, and visualise that data on a graph using a graphing library of your choice, with basic selection filters.



I have tried to connect to the mongo database that using the info that has been provided by envision.

the code I have used is something that I have tried to use before but have not been able to correctly implement it as of late.
